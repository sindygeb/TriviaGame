# TriviaGame

A landmark themed trivia game. A timer is set and the user has 10 seconds to answer the question or the game ends.

At the end of the game, the score is tallied up, presented in an alert box, as well as written onto the document.

The "Next" button then turns into a "Play Again" button.

Has concepts from original homework, as well as the advanced. Timer is set for EACH question, instead of the entire form.

The difference is that instead of the question moving forward once the user selects and answer, the user must confirm their choice by pressing the "Next Question" button. User may skip a question and his "Next" without selecting an option.
